# Weather-AI-Model
This AI/ML model uses weather data from specific regions in California to predict the chances of a wildfire. 
It uses raw noaa weather data and processes the images for real-time and accurate weather information.
This model was built for the Vulkan Fire Response App Project for NASA Space Apps Hackathon.
